# Chip8Emulator
A working Chip8 emulator in C.

# Background
After creating the [MaquinaSencillaEmulator](https://github.com/Facon/MaquinaSencillaEmulator), I wanted to try the next step, which is to emulate [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

It was not as easy as expected and the code looks horrible, but it works and it was a nice exercise to gain more knowledge on how to program emulate systems and how to use SDL library.
